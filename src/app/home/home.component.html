      <h2>What is Distributed Internet Voting?</h2>
      <p>
        With the expansive amount of technology available today, voting should be made available for everyone
        who is eligible to vote in the United States. The goal of this process is to ensure the activity is
         simple and relatively easy for the voter while maintaining the integrity of the voting process.
       </p>
      <h2>How does the Registration process work?</h2>
      <p>
        With assistance at an approved registration facility, citizen's will use the DIVA Registration form
        to register their personal information:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Identification</li>
          <li>Residential/Mailing</li>
          <li>Citizenship Documentation</li>
          <li>Biometric Documentation</li>
          <li>Political Categories</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Once documentation is submitted and reviewed for accuracy and verification, Users will be issued a
        Smart Card containing biometric and an voter ID to use in conjunction with a pin to log on for voting.
